## Curated Definitions from Quantum Information Processing

**Homodyne Detection and Heterodyne Detection**: Homodyne detection is a method of extracting information encoded as modulation of the phase and/or frequency of an oscillating signal, by comparing that signal with a standard oscillation that would be idential to the signal if it carried no information. Here, *Homodyne* signifies single frequency. In *Heterodyne Detection* dual frequencies are involved. A receiver is called Homodyne receiver when the carrier frequency *fc* is the local frequency *fLO* are same. When frequency of local oscillator is different, then the detector is called*Heterodyne Detector*.
