## Curated Definitions and Readings from Quantum Information Processing

### Definitions

**Homodyne Detection and Heterodyne Detection**: Homodyne detection is a method of extracting information encoded as modulation of the phase and/or frequency of an oscillating signal, by comparing that signal with a standard oscillation that would be idential to the signal if it carried no information. Here, *Homodyne* signifies single frequency. In *Heterodyne Detection* dual frequencies are involved. A receiver is called Homodyne receiver when the carrier frequency *fc* is the local frequency *fLO* are same. When frequency of local oscillator is different, then the detector is called*Heterodyne Detector*.

**Photon Counting**: Photon counting is a technique in which individual photons are counted using some single-photon detector (SPD). The counting efficiency is determined by the quantum efficiency and any electronic losses that are present in the system. Many photodetectors can be configured to detect individual photons, each with relative advantages and disadvantages, including a photomultiplier, geiger counter, single-photon avalanche diode, superconducting nanowire single-photon detector, transition edge sensor, or scintillation counter. Charge-coupled devices can also sometimes be used.
